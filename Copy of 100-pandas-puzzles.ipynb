Choosing the right methods and following best practices is the underlying goal.\n","\n","The exercises are loosely divided in sections. Each section has a difficulty rating; these ratings are subjective, of course, but should be a seen as a rough guide as to how inventive the required solution is.\n","\n","If you're just starting out with pandas and you are looking for some other resources, the official documentation  is very extensive. In particular, some good places get a broader overview of pandas are...\n","\n","- [10 minutes to pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html)\n","- [pandas basics](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/basics.html)\n","- [tutorials](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/tutorials.html)\n","- [cookbook and idioms](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/cookbook.html#cookbook)\n","\n","Enjoy the puzzles!\n","\n","\\* *the list of exercises is not yet complete!
